But when the crane lifted it out of its\\nsetting, the body of a woman was found secured behind\\nthe steering wheel by a seat belt. The blow had been so\\nbrutal that not a single one of her bones was left whole.\\nHer face was destroyed, her boots had been ripped apart,\\nand her clothes were in shreds. She wore a gold ring shaped\\nlike a serpent, with emerald eyes. The police established\\nthat she was the housekeeper for the new Portuguese\\nambassador and his wife.

I had\\ncome from Rome that morning, and I still remember my\\nimmediate response to her splendid soprano’s bosom, the\\nlanguid foxtails on her coat collar , and that Egyptian ring\\nin the shape of a serpent. She spoke an elementary Spanish\\nin a metallic accent without pausing for breath, and I\\nthought she was the only Austrian at the long wooden\\ntable. But no, she had been born in Colombia and had\\ncome to Austria between the wars, when she was little\\nmore than a child, to study music and voice. She was\\nabout thirty, and did not carry her years well, for she had\\nnever been pretty and had begun to age before her time.\\nBut she was a charming human being.

She never told her real name, and we\\nalways knew her by the Germanic tongue twister that we\\nLatin American students in Vienna invented for her: Frau\\nFrieda. I had just been introduced to her when I committed\\nthe happy impertinence of asking how she had come to be\\nin a world so distant and different from the windy cliffs of\\nQuindio, and she answered with a devastating:\\n‘I sell my dreams.’\\nIn reality, that was her only trade. She had been the\\nthird of eleven children born to a prosperous shopkeeper\\nin old Caldas, and as soon as she learned to speak she\\ninstituted the fine custom in her family of telling dreams\\nbefore breakfast, the time when their oracular qualities\\nare preserved in their purest form. When she was seven\\nshe dreamed that one of her brothers was carried off by a\\nflood. Her mother , out of sheer r eligious superstition,\\nforbade the boy to swim in the ravine, which was his\\nfavourite pastime. But Frau Frieda already had her own\\nsystem of prophecy.\\n‘What that dream means,’ she said, ‘isn’t that he’s\\ngoing to drown, but that he shouldn’t eat sweets.’\\nHer interpr etation seemed an infamy to a five-year -old\\nboy who could not live without his Sunday treats.

But in her first\\ncareless moment the boy choked on a piece of caramel that\\nhe was eating in secret, and there was no way to save him.\\nFrau Frieda did not think she could earn a living with\\nher talent until life caught her by the throat during the\\ncruel Viennese winters. Then she looked for work at the\\nfirst house where she would have liked to live, and when\\nshe was asked what she could do, she told only the truth:\\n‘I dream.’ A brief explanation to the lady of the house was\\nall she needed, and she was hired at a salary that just\\n2024-25\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'lekl101.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='5/I S ELL MY DREAMS\\ncovered her minor expenses, but she had a nice room and\\nthree meals a day—br eakfast in particular , when the family\\nsat down to learn the immediate future of each of its\\nmembers: the father , a r efined financier; the mother , a\\njoyful woman passionate about Romantic chamber music;\\nand two children, eleven and nine years old.

Only she could decide at breakfast what each\\nshould do that day, and how it should be done, until her\\npredictions became the sole authority in the house.

It happened on the day Pablo\\nNeruda stepped on Spanish soil for the first time since the\\nCivil W ar, on a stopover during a long sea voyage to\\nValparaiso. He spent a mor ning with us hunting big game\\nin the second-hand bookstores, and at Porter he bought\\nan old, dried-out volume with a torn binding for which he\\npaid what would have been his salary for two months at\\nthe consulate in Rangoon.

He ate three whole\\nlobsters, dissecting them with a surgeon’s skill, and at the\\nsame time devoured everyone else’s plate with his eyes\\nand tasted a little from each with a delight that made the\\ndesire to eat contagious: clams from Galicia, mussels from\\nCantabria, prawns from Alicante, sea cucumbers from the\\nCosta Brava. In the meantime, like the French, he spoke\\nof nothing but other culinary delicacies, in particular the\\nprehistoric shellfish of Chile, which he carried in his heart.\\nAll at once he stopped eating, tuned his lobster’s antennae,\\nand said to me in a very quiet voice:\\n‘There’s someone behind me who won’t stop looking at\\nme.’\\n2024-25\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'lekl101.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='7/I S ELL MY DREAMS\\nI glanced over his shoulder , and it was true.

She had grown old\\nand fat, but it was Frau Frieda, with the snake ring on her\\nindex finger .\\nShe was travelling from Naples on the same ship as\\nNeruda and his wife, but they had not seen each other on\\nboard. We invited her to have cof fee at our table, and I\\nencouraged her to talk about her dreams in order to astound\\nthe poet. He paid no attention, for from the very beginning\\nhe had announced that he did not believe in prophetic\\ndreams.\\n‘Only poetry is clairvoyant,’ he said.\\nAfter lunch, during the inevitable stroll along the\\nRamblas, I lagged behind with Frau Frieda so that we could\\nrenew our memories with no other ears listening. She told\\nme she had sold her properties in Austria and retired to\\nOporto, in Portugal, where she lived in a house that she\\ndescribed as a fake castle on a hill, from which one could\\nsee all the way across the ocean to the Americas. Although\\nshe did not say so, her conversation made it clear that,\\ndream by dream, she had taken over the entire fortune of\\nher ineffable patrons in Vienna. That did not surprise me,\\nhowever , because I had always thought her dr eams wer e\\nno more than a stratagem for surviving. And I told her so.\\nShe laughed her irr esistible laugh. ‘Y ou’re as impudent\\nas ever ,’ she said. And said no mor e, because the r est of\\nthe group had stopped to wait for Neruda to finish talking\\nin Chilean slang to the parrots along the Rambla de los\\nPájaros. When we resumed our conversation, Frau Frieda\\nchanged the subject.\\n‘By the way,’ she said, ‘you can go back to Vienna\\nnow.’\\nOnly then did I realise that thirteen years had gone by\\nsince our first meeting.\\n‘Even if your dreams are false, I’ll never go back,’ I told\\nher. ‘Just in case.’\\nAt three o’clock we left her to accompany Neruda to his\\nsacred siesta, which he took in our house after solemn\\n2024-25\\n'),\n"," Document(metadata={'source': 'lekl101.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='8/KALEIDOSCOPE\\npreparations that in some way recalled the Japanese tea\\nceremony. Some windows had to be opened and others closed\\nto achieve the perfect degree of warmth, and there had to\\nbe a certain kind of light from a certain direction, and\\nabsolute silence.

Langston Hughes, the phrase \"I sell my dreams\" appears as a metaphor for the struggle and frustration experienced by African Americans in trying to achieve their goals and aspirations in a society that is discriminatory and oppressive.\\n\\nThe importance of \"not selling one\\'s dreams,\" according to Hughes, lies in the fact that dreams represent hope, ambition, and the desire for a better future. Selling one\\'s dreams means giving up on these aspirations and settling for a life of mediocrity or even suffering. It is a sad and disheartening reality for many people who face systemic barriers to success.\\n\\nHowever, Hughes also recognizes that holding onto dreams alone is not enough. Dreams must be accompanied by action and determination. In the poem, he writes \"But I keep on trying / I will not give in\" despite the challenges and setbacks he faces.
